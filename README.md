### Building and testing locally

Dependencies: You must install NodeJS and MongoDB on your computer, you can do this via a package manager or by doing it manually.

To build the project locally you need to run `npm install` in a terminal window which is located in the root directory.
After installing all dependencies you must run `node app.js`, you will receive a message the app is listening on
a specific port.

Open up a browser and go to http://localhost:<port_number> and you will be served the main index.html file.
